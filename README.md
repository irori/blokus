# Blokus Duo

"Blokus Duo" is a two-player board game that is a variant of the original
"Blokus" game. The game is designed for strategy and spatial reasoning, and
it's relatively simple to learn but can be challenging to master.

- Select computer level and your color (violet is the first move) to start a
  game.
- Drag your piece and place it on the board.
- Double-click a piece to flip.
- Use mouse wheel or Shift+Click on a piece to rotate.

## Rules

### Components:
- A board that is 14x14 squares (smaller than the original Blokus board which
  is 20x20).
- Two sets of 21 polyomino pieces, each in a different color (usually violet
  and orange). Polyominoes are geometric shapes made of small squares. The 21
  pieces range from a single square to complex shapes made up of five squares.

### Object of the Game:
The objective is to place as many of your pieces on the board as possible,
while also trying to limit the number of pieces your opponent can place.

### Setup:
1. Each player chooses a color and takes all 21 pieces of that color.
2. The board is empty at the start.

### Rules:
1. The first player places one of their pieces on one of the two starting
   points on the board.
2. The second player places one of their pieces on the other starting point.
3. After this initial placement, each new piece you place must touch at least
   one piece of your own color, but only at the corners. The pieces cannot be
   adjacent along the edges.
4. Play alternates between the two players.
5. Once a player cannot place a piece following the corner-touching rule, that
   player must pass their turn.
6. The game continues until both players can no longer place any more pieces.

### Scoring:
At the end of the game, each player counts the number of squares in the pieces
they have left. The player with the fewest squares left over in unplaced pieces
is the winner.

### Strategies:
- Blocking: One strategy is to place your pieces in such a way as to block your
  opponent from being able to place their pieces.
- Openings: Create opportunities for your own pieces, especially the more
  complex shapes, while avoiding the creation of opportunities for your
  opponent.
